## 📁 Project Structure

This CLI is designed to be used inside a [pew](https://github.com/berdario/pew)-managed virtualenv containing an Odoo project, structured as follows:

```
<project_root>/
│
├── odoo/
├── addons/
├── project/
├── config/local.conf
└── ...
```

Make sure your virtualenv is activated before using any commands.

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `pew` for managing virtual environments
- `odoo-bin` available in your Odoo project path
